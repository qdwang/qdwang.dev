        This is a Rust crate that provides easy uploading and downloading of files and directories to web3.storage with
        optional encryption and compression. It includes a gateway availability checker and supports concurrent uploads
        of
        single files and CAR, as well as automatic file splitting for large files. It can also generate CAR from
        directories
        and supports decompression and decryption during upload and download. The aim of the project is to make working
        with web3 storage more
        efficient and secure.
